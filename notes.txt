WHY DOES DATA TYPES MATTER.
when we create a table we need to create a atleast one column and name the column defining the data type of the data 
to be entered in that column.
we define columns in a CREATE statement by including a name and a dataypte to let the sqlITE know the kind of data we will 
be storing there. 
these practice of explicitly decalring a type is known as typing.
typing allows us to excesise some level of control over our data.
it informs teh databse of the kind of data we paln to store in a column abut also restricts it.
by typing we have the ability to perform all kinds of operations such as summation, multiplication ect.

DATATYPES.
-> different databse systems also have different datatypes available, which are important and useful to know whenever 
you are dealing with those systems.
 these are :    
    1. NULL
    2. TEXT
    3. INTEGER
    4. REAL
    5. BLOB

Null -> this represents no value like null in javascript or none in python.
text -> any alphabetical characters which we ewant to represent as plain text. paragraph, name, email are texts, weight, heigh and age are however not.
integer -> anythin we want to represent as a whole number. of its a number and contains no letter or special characters or decimal points then
 we should stire it as an integer.
  if we use it to perform math or create a comparison between rows in our databse, then we definatel want to store it as an integer.

Real ->  anything thats a plain old decimal like 1.4  or 3.2342. SQLite will store decimals up to 15 characters long.
in other database systems this si called 'double precision'

NOTE that boolean values are stores as 
     0 as false and 1 as true.

also note that SQLite has a comlicated system of categorizing datatypes that involves storeage classes , type affinities and Datatypes.
